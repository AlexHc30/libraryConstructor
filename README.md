# libraryConstructor

### Create a book library using constructors, prototype and 'this'.
1. Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. 
2. Display the book in a table.
3. Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read, etc.
4. Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
5. Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.<br><br>
